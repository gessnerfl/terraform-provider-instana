# Instana Provider

**Deprecated:** This project has been handed over to and is maintained by the IBM Instana development teams. Please use the official IBM Instana Terraform provider [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/instana/instana/latest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/instana/instana/latest).

Terraform provider implementation of the Instana Web REST API. The provider can be used to configure different
assents in Instana. The provider is aligned with the REST API and links to the endpoint is provided for each 
resource. 

**NOTE:** Starting with version 0.6.0 Terraform version 0.12.x or later is required.

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "instana" {
  api_token = "secure-api-token"  
  endpoint = "<tenant>-<org>.instana.io"
  tls_skip_verify     = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `api_token` - Required - The API token which is created in the Settings area of Instana for remote access through 
the REST API. You have to make sure that you assign the proper permissions for this token to configure the desired 
resources with this provider. E.g. when User Roles should be provisioned by terraform using this provider implementation 
then the permission 'Access role configuration' must be activated. (Defaults to the environment variable `INSTANA_API_TOKEN`).
* `endpoint` - Required - The endpoint of the instana backend. For SaaS the endpoint URL has the pattern
`<tenant>-<organization>.instana.io`. For onPremise installation the endpoint URL depends on your local setup. (Defaults to the environment variable `INSTANA_ENDPOINT`).
* `tls_skip_verify` - `Ã’ptional` - Default `false` - If set to true, TLS verification will be skipped when calling Instana API
